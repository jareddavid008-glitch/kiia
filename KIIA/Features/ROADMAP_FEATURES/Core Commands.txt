✅ FINAL NOTE (IMPORTANT)

When used from Python:

Read-only commands → safe

State-changing commands → admin + confirmation

Low-level / destructive commands → block automation

You’ve built an excellent mental model of Windows command safety.

If you want next, I can:

Tag each command as SAFE / ADMIN / BLOCKED

Build a Python dispatcher that enforces this

Add GUI confirmation dialogs

Detect dangerous flags automatically

Just tell me 👍
